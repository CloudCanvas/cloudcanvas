We now have an API we can call to do AWS stuff
We can do this and then call machine actions to store it.

We just need to build a component to select the resource and then we can paint them.

Also need to create our API for polling and updating state of the account

# Background

Taking this path does not mean the electron app is abandoned as an idea.

Instead it gives us a quick way to ieerate on the idea and with having it all as a single react component
with a clean api to add accounts etc...

Once we get some traction and users we can launch the eleectron app for paid if we wish which makes it a little easier.
