Do I need an inner and outer container? Couldn't I just have a canvas that ends but can be added to anywhere?

---

Great day.

---

Not the best day. Got bogged down on tracking Dynamo changes, I should have mapped it out more before executign.

But to be fair it was very poorly documented and it makes it better for me in the long run if these things have a barrier to entry.

---

An alright day, fixed the main bugs and progressed enough to be happy on a tired day.

Want to focus on getting the Dynamo Viewer working with live mode enabled / disabled.

Pretty frustrating day in the end. Wanted to use tldraw's renderer but I got too focused on the
broken pinch aspect of it and burned a lot of time there.

It will solve a lot of problems for me though so I should go back to focusing on using it and adding custom elenments tomorrow
with the hope the pinch will be fixed.

Other points;

1. I'd like to really focus on building a React component which can be rendered for this both outside Electron and inside
   with an injected Api.
2. Would be good to have storyboard for elements to rapidly iterate on them.
3. Perhaps need to think about how the npm lib is currently constructed as it might be slow dev message passing back and forth.

On the plus there were lots of posiitive learnings about DOM vs Canvas and I got a website!!

So maybe I should not beat myself up so much. Apart from that little burned time today was good!

Why do all the hard parts come at the start of a project??

Had to finally refactor how I had designed the API to allow for things to move faster on the renderer side (hit an issue proxying mofe complex objects between them)

All good though, its done now and it's actually so much easier to work with now and I can really acclerate new components.

Also built some sexy state machines.

Now to get basic streaming working and do that console log design and we good.

---

Yeay end to end working now, just to style up some shit and we're nearly there!

---

Strange day, fought shitty library issues and variious thnigs but all came together in the end. Tomorrow

---

Getting close to being able to release and move quite fast on things. Annoying how slowed down I got getting some fundamnetals in place
but I also need these for consulting and it improves my workflow across the board so worth it.

---

Right became a bit of a pain getting everything wired together nicely anbd refactoring from a lib to the app was a pain in the ass.

Looking forward to when I learn monorepo pattern and settle into it.

Anywway it's fucking great now that it's all wired. Finally I'm back to the point of excitement! Lets get this!

---

Getting there,
